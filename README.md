## Overview

This workspace contains several Python scripts located in the `executable_files` directory. Each script loads and executes a corresponding encoded Python module from the `__encoded_files__` directory.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Ensure that the `__encoded_files__` directory contains the encoded `.pyc` files: `q1.encoded.pyc`, `q2.encoded.pyc`, `q3.encoded.pyc`, `q4.encoded.pyc`, and `q5.encoded.pyc`.

## Running the Scripts

### `executable_files/run_q1.py`

```sh
cd executable_files
python run_q1.py
